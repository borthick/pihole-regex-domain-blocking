# pihole-regex-wildcard-blocking

Quick personal blocking reference.

Pi-hole does not currently have a way to mass-import regex white/black-listing the way it does for Adlists, so for now, you'll need to copy-paste whatever you want.

jfb and DL6ER discuss it here: https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/collection-of-regex-for-blacklisting/43178/9

I will be segmenting these into a tree structure to make it as organized as possible, just in case the feature ever gets added and people don't want to block everything - you'll be able to pick and choose later.

In the meantime, you'll need to add things manually.
